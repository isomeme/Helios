Hail unto Thee who art **%1$s** in Thy **%2$s**, even unto Thee who art **%1$s** in Thy **%3$s**, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the **%4$s** of the Sun.

Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.

Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of **%5$s**.

Unity uttermost showed!  
I adore the might of Thy breath,  
Supreme and terrible God,  
Who makest the gods and death  
To tremble before Thee—  
I, I adore thee!

Appear on the throne of Ra!  
Open the ways of the Khu!  
Lighten the ways of the Ka!  
The ways of the Khabs run through  
To stir me or still me!  
Aum! let it kill me!

The light is mine; its rays consume  
Me: I have made a secret door  
Into the House of Ra and Tum,  
Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.  
I am thy Theban, O Mentu,  
The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!

By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;  
By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.  
Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!  
Bid me within thine House to dwell,  
O wingèd snake of light, Hadit!  
Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!
