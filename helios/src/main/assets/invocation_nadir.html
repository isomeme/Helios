    <h1 style="text-align: center">Midnight</h1>

    <p>Hail unto Thee who art <b>Kephra</b> in Thy <b>hiding</b>, even unto Thee who art <b>Kephra</b> in Thy <b>silence</b>, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the <b>Midnight Hour</b> of the Sun.</p>

    <p>Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.</p>

    <p>Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of <b>Evening</b>.</p>

    <p>
        Unity uttermost showed!<br/>
        I adore the might of Thy breath,<br/>
        Supreme and terrible God,<br/>
        Who makest the gods and death<br/>
        To tremble before Thee—<br/>
        I, I adore thee!<br/>
        Appear on the throne of Ra!<br/>
        Open the ways of the Khu!<br/>
        Lighten the ways of the Ka!<br/>
        The ways of the Khabs run through<br/>
        To stir me or still me!<br/>
        Aum! let it kill me!
    </p>
    <p>
        The light is mine; its rays consume<br/>
        Me: I have made a secret door<br/>
        Into the House of Ra and Tum,<br/>
        Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.<br/>
        I am thy Theban, O Mentu,<br/>
        The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!<br/>
        By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;<br/>
        By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.<br/>
        Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!<br/>
        Bid me within thine House to dwell,<br/>
        O wingèd snake of light, Hadit!<br/>
        Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!
    </p>
