<h2 style="text-align: center">Midnight</h2>

Hail unto Thee who art **Kephra** in Thy **hiding**, even unto Thee who art **Kephra** in Thy
**silence**, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the **Midnight Hour** of the Sun.

Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.

Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of **Evening**.
